    > Dynamic Array - Can change in size over time.

> Mapping - Collection of key value pairs. Think of JavaScript objects, Ruby hashes, or Python dictionary. All keys must be of the same type, and all values must be of the same type.

> Struct - Collection of Key value pairs, that can have different types.
