## A Quick Note

The next lecture gives an overview of mining with a blockchain.  This video was authored by **Anders Brownworth**.  Anders discussion of blockchains and how they work is viewed as a 'must watch' video, so I decided to include it in this course.  The video itself was included with permission by Anders.

Check out the next video, then we'll do some followup discussion on blockchains after it.
